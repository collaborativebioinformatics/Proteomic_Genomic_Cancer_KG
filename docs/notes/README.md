These are my personal notes, taken with the software [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You can browse on GitHub still, but you can click through all of the `[links](links)` in the software itself for easier browsing.

`0-Assets` and `1-Concepts` are dump folders. `2-Paper Notes` is notes on my literature review process. `3-Notes` is notes taken during the hackathon.
