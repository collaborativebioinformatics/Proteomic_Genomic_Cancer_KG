# Kg-Microbe

Harmonized bacterial and archaeal data in the form of a [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md).
## Data

Contains data sources relevant to applications of microbiology or biomedicine, structured according to the [Biolink Model](Biolink%20Model.md).

- [KG-Microbe-Core](KG-Microbe-Core)- Fesigned to contain a foundational set of broadly applicable knowledge, includes microbial organismal traits obtained from structured databases, which sourced data from literature curation or experimental assay results
- [KG-Microbe-Biomedical](KG-Microbe-Biomedical) introduces disease relevant concepts and human functional information. K
- [G-Microbe-Function] and [KG-Microbe-Biomedical-Function] also ingest microbial functional information
