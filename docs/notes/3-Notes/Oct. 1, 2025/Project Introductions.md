# Project Introductions
---

1. Large therapeutic opportunities
2. TCGA, software (proof of concept)
3. Multimodal [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md), necessary and highly sought after 
4. Hard project, on their own for researching
5. [KG-Microbe](KG-Microbe.md) as a template, needs a new team lead
	- Dissolved
6. Giraffe mapping long and short reads, agent that looks at multiple sites, associating them with phenotypic subtypes
	- Cool!
7. Combining [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md)s ("BioCypher").
8. "Moonshot project", harder to do... Pruning erroneous assertions in [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md)s
	- Expert curators involved in the loop, how do you pull it off? How do you make it easier? Especially if they have no coding experience?
9. GNNs + LLMs to concatenate embeddings (start with microbes + additional data / use cases / environmental data)
## Tips

- Building a flowchart before we start, using other bioinformatics GitHub projects as a template.
- Leverage the knowledge of the people around you.
- Meet others! :P
