[Chandak et al. - 2023 - Building a knowledge graph to enable precision medicine.pdf](file:///Users/andrew/Zotero/storage/DMM9LJL9/Chandak%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Building%20a%20knowledge%20graph%20to%20enable%20precision%20medicine.pdf)
## Summary

- [PrimeKG](PrimeKG.md) combines 20 different datasets and other resources into a massive repository of data, setting a high standard (at least for me) for knowledge graph construction. Their data wrangling techniques are amazing and their use of BERT to combine different graphs is a very cool inclusion.
## Definitions

- [PrimeKG](PrimeKG.md)

**Other KGs**
- [SPOKE](SPOKE.md) 
- [GARD](GARD.md)
- [CORD-19](CORD-19.md)
## Misc.

- Drug repurposing remained the focus of [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md) development in 2023
## Stray Thoughts

- How do you keep patient data secure when making [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md)s? I imagine it could leak like LLMs?
- `disease entity resolution challenge`?
