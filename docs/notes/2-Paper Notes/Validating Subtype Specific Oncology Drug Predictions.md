## Summary

-

---
## Definitions

- [Consensus Molecular Subtypes](Consensus%20Molecular%20Subtypes.md) (CMS) for colorectal cancer were first established in 2015 (Guinney et al., 2015)

---
## Data

- We have taken the transcriptional pathways that characterize specific molecular subtypes and crossed them with the network perturbations cited for approved drugs in the SigCom LINCS (Evangelista et al., 2022)
- First, subtyping of colon cancer patient data was performed using the CMScaller algorithm (Del Rio et al., 2017). This algorithm uses Nearest Template Prediction (Tothill et al., 2008) to classify colon cancer expression profiles into predefined subtypes. Subtyped patients were then stratified by CMS and treatment groups for survival analysis
