[Caufield et al. - 2023 - KG-Hubâ€”building and exchanging biological knowledge graphs.pdf](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/7/btad418/7211646)
## Summary

- An explanation of [KG-Hub](KG-Hub.md), data representation of [Biolink Model](Biolink%20Model.md), preprocessing of [Koza](Koza.md) and [KGX](KGX.md) (with the [TSV format](TSV%20format.md)), and an introduction to [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md)s.

> [!QUOTE]
> - A key step in KG development is identifying the concepts and relationships in Biolink Model that map to the data source being transformed.
## Definitions

- [Knowledge Graph](Knowledge%20Graph.md)
- [FAIR](FAIR.md)

## Stray Thoughts

- NLP KGs! Makes sense if we view the data as a representation of features. It then depends how they're represented (e.g. tokenization)
- Can you use KGs for images, then? How useful would that be? Is it essentially a similarity metric / clustering?
