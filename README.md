# ClassiGraph, a Colon Adenocarcinoma GNN Based Classifier

Develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to integrate proteomic and genomic features for cancer subtype classification (e.g. CPTAC-2 and CPTAC-3 breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancer data)

## Development Environment

1. Install [GithubDesktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) or git.
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics/Proteomic_Genomic_Cancer_KG.git
cd Proteomic_Genomic_Cancer_KG
```
3. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [mini-conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
4. Create conda environment
```
conda create -n cptac-kgnn python==3.12
```
5. Install python dependencies
```
pip install -e .
```

## Methods

### Dataset Aggregation

  - [CPTAC COAD](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cptac-coad/) proteomic dataset (tumor + normal), somatic mutations, clinical subtype files using Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) annotations.
  - Cleaning, filtering, and merging the data along with dropping the samples with not enough data.
  - Median imputation with missingness mask channel.

### Knowledge Graph Construction

#### Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)

### GNNs

  - [GNNMutation](https://github.com/nozlemozcan/GNNMutation/blob/main/data/README.md) - heterogeneous graph-based framework for cancer detection (**training soon!**)
  - [MVGNN](https://github.com/uta-smile/CD-MVGNN) - for predicting cancer differentiation and subtype classification
  - [MoGCN](https://github.com/Lifoof/MoGCN) - a multi-omics integration model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) was developed for cancer subtype classification and analysis 

#### Training Basic GNN

### Next Steps?

- [Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG)](https://ckg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INTRO.html), HUGE resource for analysis of proteomics clinical data.
- [DisGeNET](https://disgenet.com/), relationships between diseases and human diseases
- DrugBank
- DrugCentral
- Entrez Gene
- MONDO disease ontology
- Rectome pathway database
- Side effects knowledgebase
- ...
- You get the idea! So many more data can be added to aid classification. LLMs can be used to help bridge the gap between terms (PrimeKG style), and even images (segmentation / obj. detection) can be integrated!

## Workflow
How we approached the problem.

### Overview

  B-->C["Data Preprocessing, Merging, and Feature Analysis"];
  C-->D["Classification with GNN (using CMS)"]
```

### Steps

1. Find or construct knowledge graphs relating both cancer genomics + proteomics data
  - Knowledge base from CPTAC data: https://kb.linkedomics.org/, link to paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2023.07.007
  - Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (not a KG) https://registry.opendata.aws/ccle/
  - CIVIC (Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer) (not a KG) 4000 variants/400 diff cancers https://registry.opendata.aws/civic/
  - Multi-omics integration: Integration of large-scale multi-omic datasets: a protein-centric view - PMC
2. Add ontologies: StringDB / GO
3. With a KG (where nodes represent genes/variants), and edge index (what nodes are connected), pass to a simple graph convolutional network with a classification head -> final output: cancer subtype
4. Validation testing

### Progress of Working Pipeline

1) Download CPTAC COAD datasets (proteomics, mutations, clinical).
2) Clean, filter, and normalize proteomics data.
3) Convert to PyTorch tensors.
4) Align mutations to proteins/patients and build edge indices.
5) Load patient subtype labels.
6) Build heterogeneous PyG dataset (Patient â†” Protein).
7) Split into train/val/test.
8) Define Heterogeneous GNN.
9) Train the model and evaluate predictions.
10) Save tensors, labels, and metadata for later use.
